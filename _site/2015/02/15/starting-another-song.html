title: Starting Another Song
—</p>

<p><em>A guitar is rediscovered. I write a familiar song, which once tweaked, is uploaded for preview.</em></p>

<p>This week I’ve got my electric guitar sorted out. It had been sitting in a cupboard for a year or two; not because I didn’t want to play it, but because I’ve been learning the accordion, and playing drums, bass and acoustic guitar in various things, and there hasn’t been time or opportunity.</p>

<p>I took the guitar to Bonners in Eastbourne to set up, and collected it yesterday afternoon. I plugged it into the laptop, and cycled through some random amps in Logic Pro and just messed around enjoying myself with it. After a while, I was playing something I liked, and thought perhaps had mileage. I recorded what I was playing; a simple, funky riff. I looped that, and played around with some chords to go with it. Once I found something appropriate, I recorded that too.</p>

<p>I then plugged in the bass guitar and soon decided that a straight, on-the-beat rhythm would contrast nicely with the off-beat riff and strummed chords. I also found that changing the bass notes gave the guitar chords a completely different context, so I duplicated the guitar parts a few times and recorded the bass. </p>

<p>Just to round it off, I added some simple drums with the editor in Logic Pro. I was pretty pleased with it, and was humming it to myself. The different bass chords reminded me a little bit of an Elbow song. (I haven’t listened to much Elbow, so I didn’t know which one. I just found it; the song is Grounds for Divorce, and fortunately it’s only the first two chords of the “There’s a hole in my neighbourhood” bit, so it isn’t copying.)</p>

<p>A slight detour here, while I explain that I have done that kind of thing before. I was co-writing something with a friend, and when we stopped playing it and were doing something else, I was humming it, and then noticed I was humming something else. It took me a few minutes, but I found that it was a song I’d saved in a Spotify “scrapbook” (playlist where I dump songs I like and want to save for later), and played it. It wasn’t identical, but similar enough to be recognisable. Bummer. I rather liked it.</p>

<p>So having gone to bed last night, feeling pretty pleased to myself, I was horrified to discover I was humming Play That Funky Music to myself. My new riff! Aaargh! Again, not identical, but similar enough that I couldn’t get away with it. I wonder if there’s a name for this kind of behaviour? I don’t plagiarise on purpose; my subconscious sabotages me. Maybe that’s what’s behind the common “who are your influences” interview questions.</p>

<p>Anyway, this evening I muted the riff in Logic Pro, plugged in the guitar, and played along with the rest of the tracks until something else worked. It turned out similar, but going up from the root note instead of down, which was enough to differentiate it from Wild Cherry. There’s no words, arrangement or finesse yet, but I’ve uploaded it anyway, just because I haven’t shared anything for yonks. </p>
