Given that I'm playing all the instruments, I'm going to design the cover too. No idea what I want it
to look like. My starting point is looking through my Flickr photos for a starting point. I've found [a few
that could be the background](https://www.flickr.com/photos/harriyott/sets/72157649989121887/), which I could 
fiddle about with and add the text. I may do something different altogether, but I may as well start thinking about
it now.
