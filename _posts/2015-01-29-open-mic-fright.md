title: Open Mic Fright
---
When I eventually finish the album, I'm not going to burn it onto one CD and put it in a drawer and leave it there
and then take up parkour: I'm going to try and sell it, and promote it. There are several ways to do promote it, 
and writing a blog and posting to twitter is just part of the on-line marketing way. The main way is to actually gig it.

I've been gigging for years as part of a band. My first gig was when I was at sixth form in 1990, drumming in a band 
called Felix Kane, at the long-since-converted-to-a-posh-house Shelley Arms in Nutley. When I was at university, I was in 
several bands, playing drums or rhythm guitar. More recently, I've played bass in a couple of bands, including a small 
tour across South Africa. I've been in a couple of acoustic duets and quartets. I'm no stranger to gigging, and I love it.

However.

I've never gigged alone, and I've never been a lead singer (other than one at a "talent" night at a camp with some friends). 
I've done a little bit of backing singing, but much, and not that well. 
One day I'll probably have perform solo, probably with a guitar. It's a scary thought, but probably achievable, since the
singing lessons are going well (teach says I'm getting better).

On this album project, there are some milestones along the way: some natural, some deliberate. The first milestone towards the 
goal of gigging solo is to play three of my own songs at an open mic night. To get there, I need to learn, rehearse and perfect the
songs, having first improved my singing. I haven't played at an open mic night in years, so I've decided to go along to a few
just to watch, be inspired, and meet some new people (another part of promotion, right?).

So last night I went to my first one. I walked in to the back room, which was almost empty. It was daunting, but I was welcomed
by three friendly musicians and the landlord. About four more people arrived later in the evening, but to start with it was just
the five of us. 

The organiser played a couple of her songs to start with, and is clearly an experienced singer; very relaxed, effortless singing 
style, followed by a guy with a bit of a husky voice, maybe a little like John Mayer. Enjoyed his songs very much - he played and 
sang well. Then there was a very skilled guitarist, using alternative tunings and clever chords and rhythms, who sang amazingly. 
A big sounding, but clean voice. I won't describe the whole evening, but everyone was great.

Much as I enjoyed watching them all, I left with a feeling of inadequacy. They all seemed so much better than me, 
and I wonder if I'll ever be good enough to do this. I've been playing guitar adequately enough for years, but I just bash out
chords; there's very little else going on. Maybe I should learn and practice some new tricks, old dog that I am. I often get 
this feeling after going to a gig, but I can tell myself that they are professionals, and play full-time, and have done for years:
last night was an open mic night with 10 people in the back-room of a pub. It doesn't get smaller than that in public, and yet 
I feel way below the standard set there.

But I've had to deal with these kinds of feelings before, as many people do. I've had a successful career as a software
developer, and I still sometimes feel like an imposter. So to get past this, I'll tell myself positive things. I was a drummer
first, and that's what I play best, no point comparing my singing. I can play several instruments. 
I've written some songs. I've played loads of gigs. I'm funny. I write well. I'm improving every year. I can do this.

I recently saw Idlewild play an acoustic gig in Hove. One of my favourite bands, that I keep coming back to, years on. Towards
the end of the gig (in which the band swapped instruments a few times), Andrew the bassist took to the piano and sang a song. He had
an incredible voice, which in an X-Factor setting, would have trumped Roddy Woomble's (Idlewild's lead singer, and yes, it is a 
real name) for quality. After the applause, a well-meaning heckler shouted something like "Watch out Roddy!". Roddy smiled, shrugged,
and said "It's not a competition, we're a band". One of those moments that stays with me. A wise retort; he's secure knowing his
place in the band, and comparing individual talent isn't necessary or worth considering. Roddy's voice suits the band, and defines
it. If Andrew sang their songs, they would have a completely different character.

And so that is with me. I'm not competing with strangers at a rural open mic night. I'm writing my songs, in my style, and I will
play them and record them how I want to, to the best of my capabilities, and not with the goal of imitating someone, 
or outdoing anyone else. Just myself.
