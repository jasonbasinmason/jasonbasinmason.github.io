title: A Bit About The Songs
---
I haven't told you anything about the songs I'm recording on The Easy First Album. The songs are clearly an
important part of what's going on here. It'll be a mix of old and new songs, some of which I haven't even started yet.
Others will be recycled from things I wrote a while ago, but didn't finish, or just generally grown out of.

The first (and only) completed song is called "Big Things". I wrote that in the winter of '95. It all started
when my Cortina broke down on the way to work, and I had nothing to do until the breakdown truck arrived. 
I just sat and thought about life, and realised that I didn't do that very often. That incident became the 
backbone of the lyrics. The rest of the song is all written and the arrangement is pretty much there too - just some
little interesting bits to add to fill the sound out where appropriate. I've gigged this song a couple of times,
and it works well. One of my favourites. I think I'm ready to record this one in earnest.

"On The Landing" is even older. When I was a poor student, I used to buy second-hand guitars from wherever I could find them. 
I'd just been to Brighton, and bought a rough old acoustic guitar from Snoopers' Paradase, a massive antique shop in North Laine.
It's still there now, and just as amazing. I drove home via Ditchling Beacon, parked in the carpark looking south, and started playing.
I can't remember if I wrote the words then, but I certainly wrote the chords. It's about a fictional girlfriend who doesn't like
me playing guitar. 

I'm writing a new one called "OPC". It's based on a true story, where I went to interviews at two different companies, and what I learnt
at the first interview helped me get the job at the second company. A year later, I had an interview at the first company, and got a job there.
I'm not sure that it works yet - I've got chords that I like (and have been hanging around for a couple of years now), 
but I'm not sure about the melody yet, and the lyrics are a bit rhymey. 

OK, that'll do for now. More to come as the songs develop.
