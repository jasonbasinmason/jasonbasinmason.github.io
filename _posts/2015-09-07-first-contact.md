*Trying to email a studio*

Whilst I've been slowly and steadily writing, recording and arranging songs, I've also got to start planning on the actual studio recording. First step is to find a studio, engineer and producer. I've not really done this before (well, once, when I played in a wedding band, we paid a studio hundred quid for a morning recording a basic demo to get gigs).

I've just emailed a chap who a friend recommended, which isn't very exciting for you, to be fair. What interested me the most is that I didn't really know what to ask him. There were the obvious questions about how long it would take and how much it might cost, and a bit about what I needed to do in advance, but in the end it seemed sensible to ask him what I should ask him.

I eagerly await his reply.
