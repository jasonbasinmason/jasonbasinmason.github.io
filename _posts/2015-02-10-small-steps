*In which our protagonist discovers the sailing is not plain, and attitudes must be chosen.*

I had a couple of spare hours this evening, so I thought I'd record the acoustic guitar for Big Things. I had previously tried (and failed) recording two tracks simultaneously; one from the jack socket plugged into the audio interface, and the other using a condenser mic. After a few experiments, I managed to get everything set up correctly, and recorded a take.

It worked. Two tracks, different inputs. Upon listening back, there were a couple of places where I didn't hit the chord as I wanted, so I decided to try auto-punch recording the offending bars. I'd seen how to do this on one of the videos I've recently watched:

It sort of worked, but not usefully. It recorded on one of the two tracks, but not the other. I tried a couple of things, but couldn't get it to work, which was hugely frustrating, so I googled (with Bing), but to no avail, and then I couldn't really reach the laptop properly, so my back ached, and the mic and stand were in the way, and I don't have a desk in the “studio” because there's a massive Clavinova which belongs to someone else and I need to arrange to give it back (not that they have anywhere to put it), and I really should sort everything out before I try to do any recording, but I was hoping to achieve something listenable tonight, but I've wasted the evening and this is all going to take ages, and where am I going to get the time from, and so on into a proper grump.

I've calmed down a bit now, and realised that I have at least worked out how to record two tracks from two channels, and that's progress. I've also managed to do a bit of auto-punching, which will be useful for single-track instruments. It's all new, and complicated, and I should celebrate the small wins rather than letting irritations get the better of me.
