title: And So It Begins
---
I'm going to record an album of my songs, played by me. 
It's something I only recently realised I wanted to do,
but really, I know I've always quite fancied it. 
I just assumed I wouldn't be able to find the time,
and really, who am I to be recording an album?
Well, I'm me. And I'm jolly well going to.
