title: Knocking on heaven's DAW
---
Finally settled on a Digital Audio workstation: Logic Pro X. I was fully intending to try 30-day evaluations of a few and 
compare them properly, but I realised that was just a euphemism for procrastination, and just picked one based on recommendations
from friends who are a few steps ahead of me.

I've had a go at recording a couple of things. I bought a midi cable to connect the electronic drums to the audio interface, and 
recorded the drums as a midi track. Having recently learnt what quantizing meant, I did some of that.

I then had a go at recording acoustic guitar, just to see what would happen. I used two simultaneous recording methods; a jack from the 
guitar straight into the audio interface, and a condenser mic in front of the guitar. I had no idea how to set up Logic Pro to put
each channel in a different track, so it ended up on the same one. I'll google that with Bing another time.

I also tried recording the bass guitar. Just one input from the bass into the AI, and selecting an amp at random in Logic. The first 
take wasn't too bad, but the timekeeping was a little sloppy. 
Playing for a recording requires much more precision than playing live, so I've got some practising to do.

Having recently read about comping (recording several takes and cherry-picking the best bits from each one and merging them into a 
single track), I decided that would be the best way of recording the bass. I knew it could be done in Logic, but not how, so I packed 
away the bass. I realised I was getting ahead of myself; too eager to get going, without actually understanding enough about how Logic
works. I've found a video tutorial series that I started watching yesterday, which is great. I've watched 15 so far, and learnt how
comping works, and loads of other things too, so I'll be much more confident next time.
