Before recording anything, I need some gear. I’ve got a good range of instruments,
but nothing to record with. I went to GAK in Brighton yesterday and bought an audio 
interface, a compressor mic, a set of studio headphones (flat sound, no bass boost etc.) a mic stand, pop shield and new strings for the bass, acoustic and electric guitars. 

This evening I had a little play around to see what I could set up. I managed to get 
three tracks recorded - just a verse and chorus - with bass guitar, acoustic guitar and mandolin. Whilst successful, there are a few things to sort out, such as which volume controls are best to use; on the instrument, compressor pedal, pre-amp or audio interface,  and how to reduce the scratchy noise when changing chords (I’m sure google will tell me). Also, recording isn’t very forgiving; I’ll need to practise precision with timing.
