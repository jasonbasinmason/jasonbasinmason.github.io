title: A cool thing about being a musician
---
I'm in the writing and arranging stage of the album process. The experiment I put on SoundCloud last month is taking shape. 
Instead of playing the instruments when I'm arranging, I'm using GarageBand and virtual instruments, and there are a few advantages.

I can easily drag and drop sections in different places to hear what they sound like. It's really quick, when all I want to do
is try out an arrangement without re-recording instruments.

The virtual instruments are good enough for this process. Whilst the guitars sound rather unrealistic and the guitar strumming is odd,
it lets me know how the riff fits over different chords.

I can loop a single section, and play another virtual instrument over the top. This has been a really useful way of writing, as I can 
hear how it sounds in context. I've looped the main riff (which I think will continue throughout the whole song), and tried different
chords underneath. I can then record the chords in a different track, and build up the rest of the instruments around it. I've come up 
with a couple of pleasing keyboard parts this way.

The coolest thing though, is that I've written something I really like. I've got the song on repeat as I write this. It sounds a bit
vain to say it, but I've made something I want to listen to. A custom-made song for when I can't find anything I'd rather listen to.
It's still very much unfinished, badly mixed, has a token gesture of a bass-line and ends abruptly, but I still love it. 
At this point in time, nobody else has to like it.

Once I'm happy with the arrangement, I can then record a demo version of it and ditch the GarageBand version 
(well, I might keep it as a souvenir). Once I've mixed it I can start caring what other people 
think, and start sharing it properly. I've got to say, I'm having such fun with this.
