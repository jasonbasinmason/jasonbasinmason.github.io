*The first song is recorded as a draft arrangement*

In my career as a software developer, I've learnt that you can spend ages writing the under-the-hood algorithms and database code first, get that done and then start on the user interface, or write all the user interface first, and then 
write the code to make all the buttons do something. Either way, the customer is anxious and misled. In the first scenario, it appears that nothing is being done for ages, and it all comes together at the last minute, making it look like the 
developer has slacked off for yonks and pulled a few all-nighters at the end. In the second, it appears that the developer has nearly finished for ages, but what he has written isn't any good and he's spending ages fixing it. 
The sensible approach to appease the customer is to work from top to bottom, getting the user interface and the actual functionality written one feature at a time.

Okay, enough with the geekery. I mention all this, as I've finding a similar dichotomy with making an album. I could finish one song completely before moving onto the next, or alternatively, apply each activity (writing lyrics, recording drums, finalising arrangements etc.) 
to all songs. A third way might be to mix the two. Each has it's advantages: getting a complete song out early will build momentum, provide opportunities for early feedback, and allow the process to be improved as it goes along. 
Working on each step across all songs will be more consistent, and have less set-up and changeover time.

Early on, I decided upon three stages for recording the songs; arrangement demo, actual demo, and final studio version. The arrangement demo will be a recording of all the instruments and vocals, with everything in the right order. It doesn't have
to sound that good: the recording might be off, have background noise or hisses, and there won't be much in the way of mixing, levels, compression, reverb, EQ and so on. The purpose is to know how the songs fits together, and whether it works.

The actual demo will be everything recorded and mixed as well as I can manage. I've not done this before, so I'm expecting it to be imperfect. The last stage will be done in a studio. I'll bring along the demo, and maybe some of the tracks 
can be reused - the midi ones in particular.

So I've got as far as a first draft of an arrangement demo for Big Things. I've got drums, bass and acoustic guitar as the backbone for the song. I've recorded the lead vocals, a little piano part for the intro (which I will re-record on an accordion),
the guitar and banjo middle section, the lead guitar solo, and some pad synths for the solo and last two choruses, to fill out the sound towards the end. I'm pretty pleased with it so far. It seems to work as a song.

I've bounced it as an mp3 file and put it on my phone, so I can listen to it on the car. A pleasant side-effect of this is that I now have lead vocals playing, I can work out some harmonies and practise them while I drive. When I'm 
happy with them, I'll add them to the arrangement draft.

The next step for this song is to re-record each track until I can't improve them further. Then I can mix it properly until I have a full demo I'm happy with. 

Sometimes I have only a spare half hour, and I might not be at home, so I'll do whatever I can to work on any of the songs. It might be a simple as writing the lyrics for the first half of the second verse of a song when I'm having my lunch break. 
Whatever. Little and often will move things along.
