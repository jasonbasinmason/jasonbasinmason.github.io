title: Planning For A Journey
---


*A productive morning, preparation for a journey, and more songs than I thought I had.*

In a couple of days’ time, I’m going on a business trip to Manchester for a couple of days. As I’ll be driving, I wanted to make use of the travel time. Since I started having singing lessons, I’ve had a playlist on my phone of songs that I know all the words for, so I can sing when I’m driving and improve vowel sounds, breathing, high notes and so on. 

For this journey, however, I wanted my own songs to sing to, for some reasons. Firstly, I don’t have much time (or space) at home in order to sing. The music room doesn’t have a door (yet), so is open to the kitchen-diner and near to the lounge. I don’t want to disturb my family, nor be disturbed by them. Singing in the car is ideal, as I can’t disturb anyone.

I’ve got some finished songs, which I want to perfect; to ensure I’ve got the words in right places, I can hit the notes without problems, perfect the vowels, and improve consistency. I’ve got some songs that I want to change some or all of the words to, and some other songs for which I have no words.

I’ve been playing that funky riff I uploaded the other day in the car, and come up with some words and a tune for, so it seems driving time is good for songwriting. So this morning I spent a couple of hours recording the barest minimum (i.e. a single, strummed guitar) for all the songs, and put them on my phone (which plugs into the car stereo). 

This was super-quick. As I don’t need to worry too much about accuracy, tone, or anything else that would constitute a decent recording, I did them all in one or two takes. A couple of the songs I’ve already recorded some other parts for, so I just bounced (exported) those as they were. I’ve now got 10 songs on my phone to sing along to. That’s pretty much an album’s worth.
