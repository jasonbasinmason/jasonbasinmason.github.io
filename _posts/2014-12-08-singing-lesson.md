title: Singing Lesson

Whilst I'm at a standard I'm satisfied with for the instruments I want to play on the album, I'm not confident about my singing, and 
I know it isn't good enough. Fortunately that can be fixed with singing lessons, so I'm going to start having some. 
My first lesson is on Thursday.
